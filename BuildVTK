vcpkg is tool to build open source codes to libs.
download to vcpkg, cd to vcpkg location.
direct to using vcpkg command.

vcpkg search => list all available open source codes software.

Vcpkg helps you get C and C++ libraries on Windows.

https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/blob/8379a80abe5288c7c06d5b9ab16efe355d1c6f62/docs/EXAMPLES.md#example-1

vcpkg install boost:x64-windows

The recommended and most productive way to use vcpkg is via user-wide integration, making the system available 
for all projects you build. The user-wide integration will require administrator access the first time it is used on 
a given machine. After the first use, administrator access is no longer required and the integration is on a per-user basis.

C:\Workarea\vcpkg>vcpkg integrate install
Applied user-wide integration for this vcpkg root.

All MSBuild C++ projects can now #include any installed libraries.
Linking will be handled automatically.
Installing new libraries will make them instantly available.

Check what vcpkg libs have been installed

after google and know The vtk-package needs cmake v3.14.0
On my device cmake v3.15.x was installed.
After uninstalling cmake, vcpkg downloaded the needed version of CMake and it worked.
