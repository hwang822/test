To start building your Node.js applicNode.js is a run-time environment which includes everything you need to execute a program written in JavaScript. It’s used for running scripts on the server to render content before it is delivered to a web browser.

NPM stands for Node Package Manager, which is an application and repository for developing and sharing JavaScript code.ations, the first step is the installation of the node.js framework
Node.js also has the ability to embedded external functionality or extended functionality by making use of custom modules. These modules have to be installed separately. An example of a module is the MongoDB module which allows you to work with MongoDB databases from your Node.js application.

Installing NPM (Node Package Manager) on Windows

C:\windows\system32>node -v
v14.15.0
C:\windows\system32>npm -v
6.14.8

Basic Node.js Usage
Node.js is a framework, which means that it doesn’t work as a normal application. Instead, it interprets commands that you write. To test your new Node.js installation, create a Hello World script.

1. Start by launching a text editor of your choice.

2. Next, copy and paste the following into the text editor you’ve just opened:

var http = require('http');
 http.createServer(function (req, res) {
   res.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/html'});
   res.end('Hello World!');
 }).listen(8080);
3. Save the file, then exit. Open the PowerShell, and enter the following:

node \users\<your_username>\myprogram.js
It will look like nothing has happened. In reality, your script is running in the background. You may see a Windows Defender notice about allowing traffic – for now, click Allow.

4. Next, open a web browser, and enter the following into the address bar:

http://localhost:8080
In the very upper-left corner, you should see the text Hello World!

Right now, your computer is acting like a server. Any other computer that tries to access your system on port 8080 will see the Hello World notice.

To turn off the program, switch back to PowerShell and press Ctrl+C. The system will switch back to a command prompt. You can close this window whenever you are ready.
