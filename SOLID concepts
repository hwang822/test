S: Single Reponsiblity
Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality.
   Circle and Square only do circle and square properties - side lenth and radi lenth.

O: Open Closed
Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification.
In other workds, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.

L: Liskov Substitution
This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class.

I: Interface Segregation
Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can't do
Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

D: Dependency Inversion
Components shoudl depend on abstrations not on concretions.
